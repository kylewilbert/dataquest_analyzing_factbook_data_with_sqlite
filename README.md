# Dataquest Guided Project: Analyzing Data with SQLite Project
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth.
### Methods Used
- summary statistics
- SQL
    - basic queries
    - aggregation
- data visualization
### Technologies Used
- SQLite
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    
## Next Steps
- Which countries have the highest population density?
    - Population density is the ratio of population to land area. Compare your results with those from Wikipedia.
- Generate a histogram of population densities.
- Which countries have the highest ratios of water to land? Which countries have more water than land?
